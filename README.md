# open_hardware_template
This is a skeleton for open hardware projects, based on KiCad designs for the schematics and PCB, and some software. 

It is currently not set up as a real KiCad template, because I want to preserve the entire directory structure, including stuff managed outside of KiCad.

Thus, you have to manually rename all myproject.* files in the main folder
after cloning the repository.

The design rules are set up for OSH Park, but double-check they fit your needs before using them. 

Please do not forget to add the text "Licensed under CERN OHL v.1.2" to the silkscreen of the PCB and to the schematics.
